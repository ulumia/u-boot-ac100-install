# u-boot-ac100-install
Script to properly install U-Boot on Toshiba AC100
There are no checks to see if you are actually using Toshiba AC100 and it also assumes that the eMMC is /dev/mmcblk0 but sometimes it isn't and then it doesn't work and overall it's very simple because I'm stupid so you can do whatever you want with it
I will try to update as new versions of U-Boot are released
